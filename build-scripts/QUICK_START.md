# Quick Start - Building DarkSoul RPG

This guide shows you how to build the game with the organized build system.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`)

## Building the Game

### Step 1: Navigate to build-scripts folder

```bash
cd build-scripts
```

**IMPORTANT:** You must run all build scripts from within the `build-scripts` directory!

### Step 2: Run the appropriate build script

#### Linux
```bash
./build_linux.sh
```

#### macOS
```bash
./build_mac.sh
```

#### Windows (Command Prompt)
```cmd
build_windows.bat
```

#### Windows from WSL
```bash
./build_windows_from_wsl.sh
```

### Step 3: Find your build

The executable will be created in `build-scripts/dist/DarkSoul_RPG/`

All build outputs are organized in subdirectories within `build-scripts/`:
- `dist/` - The built executable
- `build/` - Temporary build files (auto-generated by PyInstaller)
- `distributions/` - Distribution packages (created by distribution scripts)

## Creating Distribution Packages

After building, create a distribution package:

```bash
# From build-scripts directory
./create_distribution.sh      # Linux/Mac
create_distribution.bat        # Windows

# Windows from WSL
./create_windows_distribution.sh
```

Distribution packages will be created in `build-scripts/distributions/`

## Verifying the Build

To verify all assets are included:

```bash
cd build-scripts
./verify_build.sh
```

## Directory Structure

```
DarkSoul_RPG/
├── build-scripts/          # All build files
│   ├── dist/              # Built executable output
│   ├── build/             # Temporary build files
│   ├── distributions/     # Distribution packages
│   ├── build_*.sh         # Build scripts
│   └── ...                # Other build files
├── src/                   # Game source code
├── assets/                # Game assets
├── main.py               # Entry point
└── requirements.txt      # Dependencies
```

## Troubleshooting

### "requirements.txt not found"
- Make sure you're running scripts from inside the `build-scripts` folder
- The scripts look for `../requirements.txt` in the parent directory

### "dist folder not found" (when creating distributions)
- Build the game first before creating distributions
- The build output goes to `build-scripts/dist/`

### "DarkSoul_RPG.spec not found"
- Make sure you're in the `build-scripts` directory
- The spec file is located at `build-scripts/DarkSoul_RPG.spec`

## Clean Build

To start fresh, delete the build directories:

```bash
cd build-scripts
rm -rf dist/ build/
```

Then run the build script again.
