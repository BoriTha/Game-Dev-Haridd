Where implemented:
- src/core/input.py
  - Centralized input handling via InputHandler.process_events()
  - F1-F12 key handlers, consumable hotkeys, inventory/shop input

- Use the area overlay (F10) to visualize PCG room structure and spawn zones.
- Use the wall jump debug (F9) to tune wall jump physics parameters.
- Combine God Mode + No-clip (double-tap Space) for rapid level testing and navigation.
- Use the debugger menu (F5) to access all debug features in one place.
- Use F11/F12 to quickly test door transitions in PCG mode.
- Toggle camera zoom (Z) to get a better view of large rooms or detailed areas.
- Check config/pcg_config.json to change PCG settings (seed, use_pcg flag) without code changes.
